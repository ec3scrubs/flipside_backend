i love tian tian chicken rice. i'm crazy for chicken rice. 
tian tian's chicken rice is fragrant and flavorful, but not oily. their chicken is also very tender. i always get a half white chicken, rice, and the innards (gizzard and liver) and share for 2. 
i think i slightly prefer the one in katong, but it seems all the tian tian's are about the same consistently good quality. for me, this is the benchmark for chicken rice (of which, i am crazy about).
