So I'm joining this long list of reviews to comment on the fare here. 
After Gordon Ramsey's tour of Singapore, this place is more popular than ever. I used to remember coming on particular days of the week (is it Monday) and the stall isn't even open at all! Seems like they dictate the terms where you guys can or cannot taste their chicken rice!
Seems over-rated to me after all. I came down on a weekday evening and was pleasantly surprised that they were still open at around 8. Proceeded to order a plate... and it didn't come with soup. 
The chicken is a little tough as compared to those I've eaten at other places. The chili however, is absolutely delicious. Not to hot and sweet enough for my liking. I went back to take another helping of it. Oh I didn't see them providing dark soy sauce too.
The rice is absolutely normal. There were some cucumber hidden beneath the chicken.
The experience was underwhelming and I'm sure the other stalls around like Ah Tai are already biting at their heels in contending for Chicken Rice hegemony.
