This chicken rice stall is famous because Anthony Bourdain featured it on his show. It's also how I came about finding this stall. Though, I have to say there were about 20 people ahead of me in the queue and majority of them where Singaporeans, so it can't be that bad, right? 
It's boiled chicken; honestly I think it's a cooking style that won't suit a lot of Westerners. It's more about textures rather than flavors. I ordered a large and it came with its own plate of rice. The chicken was lean with a bit of fat and the meat overall was soft and juicy. The skin was very silky and went well with the rice. Under was a layer of cucumbers, which to me was pointless.
The highlight was the rice! Superbly fragrant, a little oily and I could taste the ginger and garlic.
Chicken rice is Singapore's national dish, so it's worth trying at least once even if it's not Tian Tian's version!
