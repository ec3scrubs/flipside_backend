**OVERHYPED HAINANESE CHICKEN AND RICE**
Seriously, why the mad hype?
Thanks, Anthony Bourdain.
AMBIANCE
=========
Hawker-style.
There will be a line, but it moves quickly.
FOOD
=====
Ordered the $3.50 small order which comes with rice and steamed chicken.
Chicken and rice were decent, nothing mind blowing.
Rice wasn't THAT fragrant. The chicken wasn't THAT flavorful. 
RATING: 3/5
OVERALL
========
It's "ai-right".
Had better, but for a few bucks, it's not bad for lunch.
