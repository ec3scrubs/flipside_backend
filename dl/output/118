The line for this place (which is the longest line in the whole hawker centre) is only half-composed of obvious tourists (maybe some of the other half are non-obvious tourists, which perhaps ought to include me). It says that locals are still willing to brave the long tourist-enhanced wait for this chicken rice, despite being knowledgeable of the many alternatives. And indeed, this chicken rice is worth waiting for. There's not a whole lot of superlatives to add, except that you can definitely customize your order to include only leg meat, which I liked (I ordered 4 legs for my wife and I). Don't just order 'chicken rice' if you know anything about this dish and need to amortize your wait over more mouthfuls. 
They are also happy to give you as much chilli sauce as you might need. The meat is silky and well-seasoned on its own, but the provided chilli and dark soy sauce makes it superb! I am continually astounded by reviewers who don't seem to understand that in hawker food, the side sauces are essential additions, and not just for show, like salt and pepper on western tables. Combine with a mouthful of savory rice for a spectacular sensation. PS- there are lots of seats on the outer wings of the hawker centre, don't just look for them inside.
