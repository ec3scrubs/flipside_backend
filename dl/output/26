As many others that travel to Singapore, Tian Tian is probably on the top of their list of must try restaurants/food stalls. A local friend recommended Tian Tian (or Ah Tai if the line was too long here) so naturally I knew I would be stopping by. We had originally planned on stopping by for either lunch or dinner on Monday but after checking their business hours, we noticed they were closed that day. Seeing how we were leaving on Wednesday morning, we made the trek over to Tian Tian (don't utilize the map location on yelp as it takes you to the wrong place as this is hawker stand is inside the Maxwell food center) for an early dinner. 
It was a super muggy/hot evening so we opted to take the food back to the hotel to enjoy in an air conditioned room. We were lucky to find a short line and were in and out within 5 minutes. We ended up ordering their half chicken along with two orders of rice and an order of their bean sprouts. To our surprise, the portions were huge!!! We only ended up eating 3/4 of the chicken and maybe about 3/4 of the rice. One draw back about taking the food to go is that they didn't include the ginger oil and also some sweet soy sauce which is what we are accustomed to having along with our Hainan chicken rice. Though the chicken was super tender, I didn't think the rice was that aromatic or flavorful. Despite being disappointed with the rice, Tian Tian was 1/4 the cost of our dinner at Chatterbox. I think the perfect Hainan chicken dinner would be the chicken at Tian Tian and the rice from Chatterbox.
Tian Tian is still a must try when visiting Singapore, but I think I'll try other places before coming back again.
