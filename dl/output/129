Tian Tian does not live up to the hype. I'm someone who likes chicken rice and eats it often at various spots on the island.
Its only marginally better than some of its neighbours inside Maxwell. There is always a line of more than 10-15 people. Its not worth the wait. 
Have had consistently better in Amoy food court around the corner: isle 3, spotable by a picture of Lee Kuan Yew visiting the stall.
