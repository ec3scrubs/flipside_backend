So far, the best tasting chicken fried rice in Singapore. The rice is so fragrant and you can really taste the ginger and all other spices in it, although nothing special in the steamed or roasted chicken. Definitely 1 of the modern version of hawker with a separate line to take order and another 1 to get the food with numbered ticket that you'd get and hand down to get the order, which makes the long line during lunch move pretty fast.
