Saw this place on the show 'No Reservations' with Anthony Bourdain, so of course we had to try it on our trip to Singapore.
We walked a good 2.5 miles from our hotel to get here, but well worth the walk. 
Such a fun market place full of different foods and drinks, and across the street is the out door market place where they sell clothes and other goods. 
China town is one of the best things about Singapore, and so is Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice! 
The line is usually a bit long, and the lady there who is in charge keeps it moving (very organized). The rice is perfect and delish, and the chicken is very tender, and you will also get a bowl of Miso soup as well with your order. Make sure that you get the sauces that go with it (a spicy sauce and a thick teriyaki sauce) and your spoon and fork. The entire meal for both my husband and I was about $4.20 (American dollars). Amazing right?
So glad that we tried it! So Delicious! It's a must go to when visiting Singapore!
