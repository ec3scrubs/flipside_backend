I may not be in the majority, but while I liked the chicken rice, I wasn't falling out of my seat eating it either. It is A-OK though. Simple, warm, a slightly sweet sauce, this chicken and rice has a home-cooked taste that makes it great to eat when you're looking to fill up on a staple without much fuss. I liked it, but did not love it.
