Thanks to Bourdain, Tian Tian has achieved celebrity status. Yes it's good, but definitely not the best chicken rice in Singapore. Still if you're in Maxwell Road market during off peak hours, it's worth trying Tian Tian if the line isn't long. 
I jumped into the line when I noticed it was just a couple of folks on a weekday at around 3pm. That's when I noticed they had receipts with them. I obviously missed something. It did indeed turn out to be too good to be true. Tian Tian's recent notoriety has enabled them to take over the stall next door solely for taking orders and handling payment so customers move assembly-line style down to the next stall to receive their order. It's efficient but not very friendly. 
The rice is the star - fragrant and flavorful. The chicken is really moist and works well with the chili sauce. Thick soy sauce is available too but you have to request it which you should. All in all, pretty stellar chicken rice.
