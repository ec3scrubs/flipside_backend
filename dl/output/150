Chicken rice is the unofficial national dish of Singapore. The best chicken rice I had in Singapore was here, matter of fact, it's the best I've ever had anywhere. This hawker stall is also highly regarded as one of best chicken rice stands in the entire city-state. The chicken is very moist and tender and the rice is definitely something special; looks like a bed of plain white rice, which many other chicken rice stalls serve, but it really is more than meets the eye as it is much more flavorful than you'd expect it to be. The rice is cooked and prepared differently, using chicken stock, and the difference is definitely in the taste and it compliments the chicken perfectly. Came here twice but really wanted to come back even more times during my time in Singapore, but there was so much other food to try and only a limited amount of room in my stomach. Any future trips I have to Singapore will undoubtedly include a stop here.
