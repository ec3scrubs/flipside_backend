I had a long stopover at Changi, so hopped on the MRT and found myself near Maxwell Road. I knew this place was somewhere around there, so after walking around for about 20 minutes, I found it in the hawker centre. There wasn't a queue when I was there (I was eating at about 4pm, an odd time thanks to my jet-lag inducing travel), so service was quick. This is simply the BEST chicken rice I have ever tasted -- juicy, tender, and a good amount. The chili sauce made it oh so better.
