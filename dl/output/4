This was the only steamed chicken rice I tried in Singapore, so I can't say for sure that it's the best chicken rice in SG, but it was definitely quite amazing. The chicken is juicy and flavorful and I really loved the light sauce on it, which had an amazing taste. The rice is fluffy and lightly tasty. I didn't really love the soy sauce/ chili sauce to add on top, so adding those did mess up the dish a little for me but didnt' change how amazing the chicken was. It's simple and lovely and perfectly cooked - a must-have dish when you're in SG.
