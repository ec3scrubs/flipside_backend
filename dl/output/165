3.5 this may be the most famous hainan chicken rice because Bourdain was here, but after eating it, I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed. moist white meat with a good ginger chili sauce is important along with a chicken flavored rice, but it just wasn't something I was craving afterwards. lots to try in all these food centers, and yes the crowded ones are typically good.
