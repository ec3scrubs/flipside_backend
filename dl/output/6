Amid the sea of hawker stalls that make up the Maxwell Road Food Center, one stands out to even the casual observer. It alone has a line/queue. Apparantely Tian Tian has people waiting for its food virtually all the time. I visited during what I thought would be a between-meal lull in foot traffic, around 4PM, and sure enough there were still about 10 people waiting ahead of me. No other stall in the Center had a queue.
The reason is obvious after you taste their Chicken Rice. How they infuse so much flavor into the chicken meat from a boiling/steaming cooking process is remarkable. The bowl of clear broth that comes with it has a similar flavor and is quite nice. The "Vegetable with Oyster Sauce" dish that I also ordered was surprising delicious: baby bok choy infused with thse same wonderful flavors found in the chicken. And all of it came to a little over S$6.00 (US$5.00) for food quality that many much more expensive Asian restuarants can't match.
[A hint for fellow tourists: hawker stalls like this don't provide napkins, and to use the wash rooms to clean up will cost you ten cents (exact change helps). Also Tian Tian doesn't sell beverages. For something with an Asian flair that's easily accessible to everyone's palate I recommend the sugar cane juice from the stall directly across from Tian Tian].
