I'm hoping this is the one located at Maxwell Center in Chinatown!
This spot is especially popular because their chicken and rice beat Gordan Ramsay at a competition. Rightfully so because the chicken (non-broiled) was tasty requiring no sauce (or ketchup for that matter). It did come with an orangey-chili sauce for additional dipping if you choose. The rice was fragrant and went well with the chicken. 
Wait was not long at all, most likely because I went in the afternoon, after the lunch rush.
