Queue goes pretty fast even with the long lines b/c he is like the soup nazi. You get what you get. No extra toppings/sauces unless you specifically ask for it (ginger, hot sauce, cilantro, ect) or buy the whole chicken. The neighboring stalls that serves chicken and rice gives you the all condiment spices w/out any attitude. 
Not a fan of chicken and rice but have to admit, Tian Tian chicken is pretty good.
