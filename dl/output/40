In Los Angeles, there's only 1 restaurant that serves a respectable hainan chicken, so that is really all I know about Hainan Chicken. On my trip to Singapore, I was determined to find one that is clearly better. After 5-6 restaurants and stands at hawker markets and food courts, I was starting to think that my go-to Hainan chicken rice restaurant in Los Angeles is as good as it was going to get (other than the fact that the price in LA is higher than that in Singapore). Luckily, I marked up Tian Tian, which is highly regarded by Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay, and made a point to come try this.
WOW! The chicken was silky, clean-tasting yet flavorful. The rice smelled AMAZING and tasted even better. The red sauce added a special kick. My girlfriend and I devoured half of a chicken, and took 2 chicken rice plates to go! This is what Singapore is all about, and I can finally return home happy, knowing that the Hainan chicken in SE Asia is not an unfortunate hype.
