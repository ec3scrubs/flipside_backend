They're famous for their chicken and rice, supposedly in part because of Anthony Bourdain. The queue/line was long, even on a Sunday around 2:30, but moves relative quickly. And for $3.50 SGD, the chicken rice dish is probably one of the least expensive dish you can buy at this hawker center. And at that price, the serving portion (of chicken) is not particularly large... but you do get plenty of rice to fill your belly up. As for the famous chicken, the 6 or 7 slices are soft, moist and flavorful. Though I do wonder how much of that tasty flavor was from the broth they spoon on the dish before serving. 
I'm giving Tian Tian 4 stars... If this dish was served at another hawker stand, I would prob give it 3 stars. But eating out is never just about food alone, and factor in the whole experience of waiting in a long line along with everyone else ordering chicken rice... That deserves one more star in my opinion.
