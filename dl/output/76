Located inside the Maxwell Food Court, just a short walk from the Chinatown MRT station. Long line, so the best time to go is before lunch or after the lunch hour crowd. The line moves very fast and the service very efficient and organized. The Chicken is very moist, tendet and juicy, the rice fluffy and perfectly seasoned. The Bean Sprout was cooked just right. Must definitely try the Tian Tian Chicken Rice is you are in the area, or when visiting Singapore. Simple dish, but so good. Great to have a good quality meal at a very affordable price. Highly recommended.
