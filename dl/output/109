This was this was the only stall that had a line, a long long line. I imagine that this is partly because of the celebrity hype and advertising. Nevertheless, I waited. It was good. The chicken was tender and the rice was flavorful. Was it worth the wait? Not really sure. There were other stalls selling chicken rice that looked the same, however, there were locals waiting for the TianTian. I asked one guy in line and he assured me this was better than the others. 
For S$5, I got a huge plate of rice and chicken with a few slices of cucumber and sauces, plus a bowl of broth. All in all, a really good filling meal for a small amount of money. Try the fried bananas at stall next row over, delicious.
