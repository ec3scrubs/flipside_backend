This place is featured on nearly every travel programme, so I felt I had to check it out. I was not disappointed. The chicken was the best I've ever had anywhere in the world. Pillow soft, tender and perfectly cooked. Even the fat was tasty. The rice was aromatic and the perfect accompaniment. I would have preferred if the brown sauce was left off, as all this dish needs is the thick soy sauce and ginger/chili paste to flavor it. And at SIN $7 it's a steal.
