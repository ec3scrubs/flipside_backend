When I reached maxwell food center at around 11.30 am. There were at least 10-15 people in front of me. There are two sections of the store. One for paying and order bigger plates, the other one collection.
All I could say is yum!! The rice has interesting flavours and the chicken was tender - well-cooked. I was impressed by the overall deliciousness of the chicken rice. 
This is a must try place. Especially for tourist :)
