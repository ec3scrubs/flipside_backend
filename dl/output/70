No Queue?
The whole Maxwell Food Centre was just so quiet at around 4:00 pm. But I was not complaining since I hate queueing up for anything? Or was that my Yelp Friend??
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice was good... Really good. Tender chicken with fragrant rice. It might not be the best in Singapore but I felt like I was in one of Anthony Bourdain's show and got to travel around the world and eat... (but I really here travelling the world just to eat?)
I will remember this chicken rice whenever I have the "chicken rice" at home, the tasteless chicken that were dry and tough..... Even the soy sauce here tasted much better...
