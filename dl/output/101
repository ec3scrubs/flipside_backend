3 stars. I didn't really need to look up online to find out where to eat at the Maxwell Food center, I just needed to find the stalls that had a line and this one definitely had a line. I enjoyed the Hainan Chicken Rice here. Ended up ordering half a chicken and boy was it large in size. Usually when you order half a chicken, you'd be lucky that it would ever come in this size. This is probably a Chicken that was fed hormones/anti-biotics or something because it was huge. Usually organic/non anti-biotics chickens don't get this big so that's just my speculation. The sauce that was drenched all over the chicken might have been a bit much, would have preferred no drenching of the chicken, it didn't add much to the flavor and it just make more wet than it needs to be. The chicken was very tender and juicy both the dark meat and the white meat. Rice was very well done full of flavor. I would definitely come here again if I'm in Singapore again for my Hainan chicken rice cravings but sadly I don't think it's the best Hainan chicken rice I've ever had. I think places in Hong Kong did a better job. But regardless if I'm in the area, I'd still come back! and yes like all stalls at a Hawker center, it's cash only!
