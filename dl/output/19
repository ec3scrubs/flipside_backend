Holy cow. Thank you Anthony Bourdain for telling the world about this place. The line is never ending, but damnnnn this place is the bomb. Once you finally get to the front, order that chicken with rice. The chicken is good but the chicken flavored rice is the star of the show....I can eat that rice ALL DAY LONG
