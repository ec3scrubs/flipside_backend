Saw this on Anthony Bourdain so we had to add it to the list. The queue wrapped around the back of the building. I don't know what they do to this chicken and I don't care. I just want it to get into my mouth now. I have never had such delicious, tender, juicy chicken in my life. If I lived in Singapore I would eat this every day.
