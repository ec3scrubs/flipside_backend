Indeed, there is no doubt Tian Tian earned top spot for Chicken Rice.
- The chicken is succulent; The best way to figure it out is order the "breast portion"; White meat tends to be dryer. Yet, Tian Tian manages to make it tender.
- The rice, what can we say about the rice! The key to good restaurant is the rice. The rice is moist; while your chicken head back to be grind by your molar; your incisors and premolar would nicely bit on those moist rice. What a delicious blend.
People wonder, why would I give a 4 stars instead of a 5? 
For a food court that is not in the indoor AC, and they charge for $4.50 on my visit in Nov, 2013. It is a 50 cents to a dollar to pricey.
