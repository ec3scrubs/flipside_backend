Came by for dinner the other day. The experience was quick. Ordered at the counter and requested all dark meat...there was a slight surcharge.
Stepped up a few steps and they put together my order within 30 seconds.
The hainan chicken was world class and very moist. ...despite requesting all dark meat, I found some white meat?!?
The rice was fragrant and the soup was decent, although a tad oily.
The most challenging part of the meal was the humid outdoor environment...
Note: They're closed on Mondays.
...do triple check the name of the stall..there are a lot of knock-offs in the same area!
