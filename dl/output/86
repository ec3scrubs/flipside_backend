I thought it was cute that Tian Tian hawker stall gave out a number along with the printed receipt. Guess they are THAT popular and famous that they have one window to pay and another to get your food, when most hawker stallls are usually a one or two man show. 
The chicken rice here, along with the one in Far East Plaza, is supposedly the most popular in Singapore for chiken rice. But the blue sign hawker stall on the second floor of Golden Shoe hawker is just as good, and my coworkes and I frequent this one more often as it's right next to our work in raffles place. Can't choose! all three are good, with juicy chicken and fragrant rice. I always get the steamed chicken rice with no skin, with extra hot sauce.
