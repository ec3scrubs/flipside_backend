Came to Maxwell Road Hawker Centre right before lunch time to stand in line for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. Honestly the queue was about 15 min. max as it moves very very quickly (even though the line wrapped around the stall). Sorry I can't remember the price in USD, but I'm sure it's under $10.
I kinda knew what I was going to get into. Fragrant oily rice and soft boiled chicken with skin. Garlic/ginger spicy sauce and dark soy sauce to mix together. What can I say, I'm not a huge fan of boiled room temp. chicken. Now deep fry that bad boy and we talkin' about a real GOOD meal! lol j/k. 
One persons opinion doesn't really mean much. My palate is not the same as anyone else's, so we all have to try out dishes for ourselves, right? How about I share some pics.
