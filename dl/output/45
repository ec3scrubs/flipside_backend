I traveled thousands of miles (again) to eat something that looked 'kinda interesting' on an Anthony Bourdain Program. I'm not saying it's not good, just sayin I gotta stop being such a fanboy! Every time I feel like a super-gritty explorer only to find a shrine to ol'Tony and a mutated hipster-behemoth of a food stall. I don't blame the owners either, gut those 'foodies' with their selfie-sticks - or make that us, minus the selphie stick... aah, don't listen to me, I guess I'm just jaded^^ 3 Stars says it's A ok - following the laws of the free market, that should go for every Chicken Rice Place in the area tho...
