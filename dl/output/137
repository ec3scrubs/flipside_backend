Hiding from the torrential rains we snuck into Maxwell and gravitated to this stall like moths to a flame.
God knows if Chef Sao will be able to keep up their signature dish with all the Bourdain madness lately. 
With no line greeting us, we happily munched on our plates of Chicken Rice, wiping our faces of condiments and bits of chicken. So good. Oh... so good. 
Well worth the visit!
