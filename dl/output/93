I was all about chicken rice @ Tian Tian the entire time I was in Singapore. When I finally had the chance to try it out, it just turned out to be A-OK. The chicken was fine but the rice was a bit hard -- one notch away from the uncooked categorization. I ended up getting chicken rice three stalls down at Ah Tai, which I liked so much better. It was what I thought the experience would have been like.
And oh, maybe it's just me ... but I thought it was weird being forced to stare at Anthony Bourdain's picture while I was standing in line. The hype train is strong.
