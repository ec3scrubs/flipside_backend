This place is overhyped. The chicken rice is average. The line was pretty long when I arrived at around 1230 on a weekday but the stall uncles were very efficient and the line moved very fast.
Chicken meat: abit dry. Texture is not great.
Rice: fragrant and moist
Chilli sauce: good! Typical chicken rice chilli sauce 
The chicken rice is drizzled with some sauce and the sauce is too salty. You can probably request to not have the sauce.
Also the soup was not provided till asked. Soup is very bland. 
The stall owner also requested for us to hold the plates in our hands instead of using the trays to hold the plates. (I went with a friend and we had bought 2 plates).
