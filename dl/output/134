The reputation this place has is well deserved. Be prepared to have some of the best chicken rice possible - perfectly tender and packed full of flavor. The rice is so good it's up there with top-notch sushi.
Depending on the time of day, there can be quite a wait but it's easily worth it. I'd recommend washing the meal down with some avocado juice from a nearby vendor.
