of course, i went on recommendation from anthony bourdain. easy to spot with the anthony bourdain signs. i got to the store 30 min before they opened, but there was already a line of people waiting. i ordered the hainanese chicken as expected, and sat myself at one of the tables. i have to say i wasn't overly impressed with the chicken. don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't earth shattering as expected. i've had better at other hawker centers. again, everything was well prepared though, and the food was good, but it just wasn't amazing. maybe i came with too high expectations?
the price was obviously very affordable (less than $5). i would definitely have this any day over the regular fast food you find in the US. but if you're looking for good hainanese chicken, there are plenty of other hawker centers that provide better.
