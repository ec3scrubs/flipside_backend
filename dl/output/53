I was expecting so much from this place. Maybe because my preference is skewed and the Singapore style is different. Maybe because it was so over hyped "best hainan chicken in Singapore" and considering this is the must try place. 
I got the hainan chicken and rice. The rice was okay. I the chicken was okay too. When it came out it was like warm at most. The chicken wasn't juicy and flavorful as what I expected.
