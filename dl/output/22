I can literally eat this everyday. There may be better chicken rices out there but if you are risk adverse, then come here and take a seat--you will not be disappointed. This is a tried and true spot (even by the locals). I got a medium order and wished I had ordered a large.
Be adventurous and try the orange ginger sauce.
