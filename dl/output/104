This place is so hyped up on the internet. Despite locals telling me not to eat here, I had to see for myself. Service/attitude was brusque. I ordered a plate of chicken rice for 3.50. They give you chili sauce (in addition to whatever sauce they pour on) but no other sauce which may have soured my experience. The chicken itself was tender but that and the rice was pretty much flavorless. The only good thing is I only waited about 5 minutes in line.
