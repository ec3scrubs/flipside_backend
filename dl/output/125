Yes, it really is that good, and yet so simple. When I went to Singapore, I thought I needed hours of research to find the food hot spots of the city. Wrong. I thought Open Table, Zagat, and Trip Advisor would sort the lot. Wrong. 
  All you need to do is visit the "hawker malls" and look for the longest lines. So I qued up here not even knowing what I was ordering till I was 3rd in line. I have had this dish before and never "got it" till now. Tian Tian chicken is prefect as is the rice and chili sauce. It can not be describled it simply must be experienced.
