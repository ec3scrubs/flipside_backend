Who would have thought that a dish so simple could be so delicious and comforting. Had to try some Hainan chicken rice after watching Anthony Bourdain on No Reservations rave about Tian Tian! Luckily our hotel was literally walking distance right across from the Maxwell food court so I was ready to eat this every single day it was that delicious!! For $3.50 Singapore dollars which was basically equivalent to ~$3 US you get a pretty decent portion of chicken and rice plus a bowl of the chicken broth. The rice smells heavenly. The chicken is moist but pretty bland by itself. However, it's all about mixing the chili sauce and brown sauce with your chicken! My goodness! There is usually a line so be prepared for a wait but there at Tian Tian the service is pretty fast! Definitely a must have while visiting Singapore!!!
