Actually, even though the queues are long, they move fairly fast from my experience. The chicken rice is a clear winner, and the star of the dish. Chicken is tender and good too, but the rice is heavenly! Especially with the chilli which really does pack a punch. My advice? Come at the right time so you don't have to wait too long and prepare your order for your turn so you don't incur the wrath of the owner or other customers waiting in line!
