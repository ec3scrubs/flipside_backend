I honestly don't understand why this place is rated as highly as it is.
Yes the rice is very fragrant and the chili's pretty good but the chicken is rather disappointing.
Personally I think you get better chicken at Boon Tong Kee, Wee Nam Kee, or even Five Star. It really boils down to what's important for you I suppose, and although the queue wasn't that bad on a Friday afternoon (at around 3pm), the food just didn't really impress me.
I'm saying nay to Tian Tian's reputation as best chicken rice in Singapore.
