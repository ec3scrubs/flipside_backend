Maybe I'm just not a Chicken Rice kind of gal. I came to Maxwell Center to try the chicken rice at Tian Tian where Anthony Bourdain raved about the chicken. I ate one ligament-filled, slimy piece and left the rest. The rice was fine, but I'm not a fan of the slug-texture chicken that seems raw and feels rubbery. It is very cheap (SG$ 3.50). If you love this stuff, don't worry: the line moves very quickly. The servers are curt and uncommunicative - you aren't allowed one of those plastic cafeteria trays unless you're ordering multiple meals. Unfortunately, if this is as good as it gets, I'm swearing off this Singaporean national food.
