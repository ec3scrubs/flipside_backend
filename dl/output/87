the chicken is so smooth and perfectly cooked, the price point is just right but the taste a bit bland for me. i've had better hainanese chicken in the US. but it is worth the trip. we went on a Saturday prior to the lunch rush perhaps? the line wasn't too long and was very efficient. the best time is probably to show up 11a-12pm. lots of people were ordering half chickens but we wanted to try other things so we just had 2 hainese chicken dishes with rice. they also try to upsell you with a plate of veggies.
