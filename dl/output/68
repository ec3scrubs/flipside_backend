I had to go here due to the infamy gained from Bourdain. And I usually agree with his assessment. This place is good and on par with Chatterbox at 1/5 the price. Now, I have only been here since they expanded, but here's what I got: rice is more flavorful than Chatterbox but not by much. Chicken was dry and full of bones. Bourdain mentioned this was a go to spot with chicken that didn't need the sauce, but Tian Tian put it on anyway. On my visit, the chicken was dry. If you are visiting and pass through the "foreigner" checkpoint at Chatterbox, this is the next logical step to get an authentic Hawker table in Chinatown. If you want the best and can make your way to Yishun, Jiefuji is my top pick for best in the Island Nation. 
Otherwise, this place is a solid 3.5 Stars!
