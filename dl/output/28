Overall, the longest lines are reserved for Tian Tian, and overall, the food was good.
I waited about 15 minutes in line in order to order and get my food. They have it down to a science (i.e. efficient), so make sure you take a look at the menu before you get to the woman who takes your order (pay in one place, move down the line to another place to pick up your food). I ordered:
Chicken and rice: while the chicken was moist, I think that I like the rice even more: very, very fragrant chicken smell and taste
Bok Choy in oyster sauce: while this was good, it was actually more expensive than the chicken and rice itself. Next time, I would skip the veggies and fill up with other good food in this centre.
Overall, Tian Tian met my expectations, but I wouldn't say that I was blown away. Still, it's probably a must-eat while in Singapore for tourists.
