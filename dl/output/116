Chicken + Rice. Um.. how good can this be? 
I was really, really skeptical to say the least, but it's a surprisingly good dish, and for $5 it's great value. The chicken is juicy and the rice is really flavourful, with hints of ginger. 
I was told the original cook from Tian Tian left and started his own stall, Ah Tien, two doors down. So I tried them side by side, and they're about the same. I did like Ah Tien's rice a little bit better, it was a bit more fragrant but they're both more or less the same. Ah Tien has some different sauces you can try as well.
