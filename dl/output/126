You'll never fail to find it. It is inside the Maxwell Food Center in the middle with the longest queue. 
Chicken is so tender and juicy and rice is tasty. Also the soup is a big surprise. 
The small chicken rice set is never enough for me. At least half of a chicken and a bowl of rice is enough.
Once you had it, you'll never forget. Remember to eat hot.
However, since it's just inside the Maxwell food center, it would be rather busy during rush hours. Sometimes you may have to take a little while to find a seat.
