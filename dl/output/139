The rice is freakin incredible!!! Wow I was surprised just how good the dish was. I added the garlic hot sauce and that really took it up a level. Just goes to show you how good a simple dish of chicken and rice can be. Excellent food and glad I visited the Maxwell Food Centre it was a great experience.
