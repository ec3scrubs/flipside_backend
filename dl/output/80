Dear Anthony Bourdain,
With "no reservations", I'm writing due to my fair lady, who has been one of your many fans for the longest time, for your video highlighting the chicken rice experience in Singapore. Before her visit to Singapore, she sent me a link to your video (I'm sorry I've never cared enough to watch any of your shows even though I'm practically always on Food Network) and MADE me watch it so that I could bring her there.
Well, that's the thing...that video and your stupid picture on the stall makes people think that the stall is freaking good because you "approved" it.
Oh, please.
It is quite obvious in the video that you would have never tried chicken rice if the crowd didn't BOO the living crap out of you (which I've done since I first watched one of your shows).
So I must say - as I did to my fair lady - that I knew of Tian Tian way before you even highlighted it in your story. Singaporeans know their food and will never need your picture or "approval" to seal in the awesomeness of a particular stall.
For example, I just look for a freaking line that is longer than your achievements and know that the food will be GREAT. Just like on the day that I binged on two orders of chicken rice to try both the roast and the standard steamed version...I tried the porridge with a line that took nearly 40 minutes before I got to order...that DIDN'T have your face on their stall.
For the record, do us all non-fans of yours a favor before we bash you even more and tell the truth to your fans (such as my fair lady) that your "approval" of this stall is worthless because your opinion on Asian food (or all other local food) just doesn't count. Not to mention, if the crowd didn't boo you, I'm 100% sure you wouldn't have tried chicken rice.
You fail.
Tian Tian just WINS enough to grace you with their attention so you can make a buck by featuring it.
Get a real chef job.
Sincerely,
ChickenRice-Fan
