This is my absolute favorite place for hainan chicken and rice. I dream about this place. I had this a few years ago and I live to far to be able to eat it all the time. I remembered that the first day when we arrived in Singapore we ate here. I was so glad this place was literally right across the street from where we stayed. I think I ate here 3 times before we left. The chicken is perfectly cooked and the sauce that you use to dip your chicken is amazing! The rice is not oily at all either. 
Tian Tian see you in a few weeks!!!
