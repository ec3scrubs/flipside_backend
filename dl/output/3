Located at the Maxwell Hawker Center, this chicken rice stall may just be all hype due to Anthony Bourdain's episode in Singapore. The line for this stall is usually very long on the weekends, but I was able to go on a weekday with no wait. Yes, the chicken rice was great, juicy, and plump. However, any other chicken rice stall around Singapore has similar chicken rice that tastes just as great. It was $3.50 SGD at Tian Tian for the white chicken rice (no soup given). However, I am able to find some places around Singapore that sells chicken rice that is just as great for $2.50 SGD and they give you soup. 
Give this place a try if you like, but if the line is extremely long I say you should try chicken rice at another stall.
