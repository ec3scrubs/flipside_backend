If you're a fan of Anthony Bourdain and his show "No Reservations," then you've probably heard of Tian Tian and their famous chicken rice. When I first came to Singapore, my #1 to do was to eat chicken rice from Tian Tian and their stall in Maxwell food centre. 
I popped in real early as I wanted to beat the queue. As soon as the stall opened, I was first in line. I ordered the standard chicken rice set and after 1 minute of waiting, a serving of chicken, rice, soup and garlic chili sauce was waiting for me. After I found an empty table, I threw some garlic chili on top of my dish and dug in. The moment the mix of chili, rice and chicken hit my tongue was like ecstasy. It was as if I had lost my virginity all over again (okay, maybe not quite the same). 
Plenty of time has passed after my first time there, and I can proudly admit that I've eaten the chicken rice there at least 20 more times after that. Whenever I have visitors, I always make sure to take them to Tian and Tian and have them experience it for themselves. It's a must.
