I am definitely not surprised that this place has more Yelp reviews than any other place in Singapore. 
This place is heaven. NO JOKE.
I came to Singapore to eat. I wanted to try all the Hainan Chicken Rice out there. Before coming to Tian Tian, I had about 7-8 different Hainan Chicken Rice from places all over Singapore. Honestly, they were good, but NOT amazing. 
I got to the stall at around 11am. There were only a few people in front of me. For two people, we shared half a chicken and rice. THE CHICKEN WAS SO TENDER AND FLAVORFUL. AND THE RICE OMG. You can literally just eat the rice by itself. It was so fragrant. All the other chicken rice we ate, we ad leftover rice, but this place, we cleaned the plate in less than 5 minutes. ALSO, the SPICY SAUCE, is sooooo amazing. I love spicy food and it had the perfect kick. 
It was so good that we took two more orders to go with us to Sentosa to eat on the beach. Don't judge me! 
My only complaint is that the chicken had a lot of bones. Other places made it with chicken breast and no bones so it was a lot easier to eat and less fatty. 
If I ever come back to Singapore, it would be for Tian Tian, nothing else. 
I MISS IT ALREADY.
