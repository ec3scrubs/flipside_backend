Ate here several times over the course of a few days. Had the chicken rice, and fortified it with an extra drumstick, which was deboned! Of all the food stalls at the Maxwell Centre, this is the only one that has a line. It is also the only one that will run out of food. Geez, I still dream of this chicken.
