Hainanese Chicken yummy !
This place serves up a nice flavorfull meal with local ingredients that just make it unique. The chicken i lightly seasoned and moist with hints of ginger and sesame seed oil.
I have been around and this is a pretty good dish for the price.
Its not the best but pretty close to where it needs to be.
If you are in the area do try it.
