Famous for its chicken rice, that some people call the best in Singapore, it is indeed a great place to enjoy this delicious and typical Singaporean dish! All the more so as the price is very affordable price (less than 5SGD).
However, I was a bit disappointed after the excellent reviews I read about it! The chicken was indeed not bad but there were little pieces of bones inside of it (I never had them in other chicken rice stalls I tried in Singapore) and the rice was not exceptional. I guess it was okay but I had better rice in other stalls, and it is still a big thing in that dish!
So overall, it is a good place to eat but maybe not worth the long queue...
