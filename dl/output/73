Ever since their chief quit, the chicken rice is never the same. 
Chicken is not as tender as before. 
Rice is most time a bit too hard. Also they have lose their signature fragrance which they use to have for their rice. 
So far, only their sauce which they pour over chicken and chili sauce detent the same standard. 
TianTian is now more like a tourist spot than a famous chicken rice stall which I use to know. 
The long queue is still there but no longer the locals but replace by all the tourist. 
It's just living on their past reputation. 
*Something to note. Their ex-chef open a stall just a few stall away. I believe many have mention that. 
Other than the chili sauce. They win hands down.
