Anthony Bourdain is either a liar, a moron, or both.
There is no way in hell the chicken rice dish is anything more than what it is - bland chicken and rice.
Luckily, I didn't have to wait long, but I would warn everyone to not waste more than five minutes to try this place. Just three stalls down, you'll find the same thing made by the same chef that used to cook the chicken for twenty years at Tian Tian.
Anyways, I ordered that drumstick ($4.20) rather than the breast ($3.50). That was a mistake because the dark meat was not fully cooked. It was rubbery, which is indicative of undercooked poultry. Dark meat takes a bit longer to cook. I returned the dish to them and asked for the breast meat. They didn't argue with me and gave me a new plate. The breast meat was indeed moist and tender, but that's about it. There's nothing going for it. The rice was whatever. 
I'm not sure what Bourdain was on when he had this. He must have been high, drunk, or was just being polite. 
I would pass on this stall and the wait.
