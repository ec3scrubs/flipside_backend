There was a loong line for this place, (ever since Anthony Bourdain said this spot was awesome) but it moved pretty quickly. I think I waited around 20 minutes. While I was waiting I kept seeing people walk away with the chicken and rice (there's enough pictures of 'em on yelp as it is!) and I kept thinking, that's it?? It doesn't even look good....
And nope, it wasn't! I guess the rice was good, but the chicken was pretty bland. 'Eh. It's cheap just like all the hawker food in Singapore, but I wouldn't wait to eat here again! There was so many other great food in the other food stands.
