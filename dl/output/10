I didn't think the menu would be that complicated so I said uhhhh 1 order please? (expecting a little help). Somehow I ended up with skinless chicken breast. They pour a thin gravy over it and that's all you get over rice. 
Everything was bland. Very disappointed. They're probably resting on their laurels at this point, although I'm not sure if it was ever deserved, just press from Bourdain....
Tong Fong Fatt in this same Maxwell Food center was better, at least it came with soy and chili sauce. 
Rooster &amp; Rice in SF is the best haha!
