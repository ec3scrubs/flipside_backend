The hype did not live up to the expectation.
In terms of ice bath chickens, I've definitely had better such as at Nong's Khao Man Gai in Portland, OR. 
I got half a chicken for $12 and the dark meat was fine and dandy. The white meat was a bit on the drier and tasteless side. 
The chicken rice and hot sauce were delicious though but not enough to carry this dish to a 4 stars and up.
