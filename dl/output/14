Literally the best hainanese chicken Ive ever had. The chicken is so tender and juicy. Dont forget the orangey sauce, its delicious with the chicken and rice. The line is long but come early once they sell out thats it, they close shop. Dont be fooled there is another hainanese chicken shop nearby theirs that starts preparing and getting long lines by unsuspecting tourists when this place closes.
