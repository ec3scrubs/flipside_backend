Dear Anthony Bourdain, I'm glad you no longer have a restaurant so I won't suffer the disappointment of high expectations. Generally, I hate queuing for food, but after reading many fantastic reviews and recommendations, I left the bf in queue with a cold beer to pacify him while I went in search of supplemental food. The tables were packed. Fortunately I managed to chope a table by Maxwell Road, a bit of road construction noise, but the cool breeze makes eating beatable unlike the hothouse conditions of the rest of the food centre. Ok, so back to the chicken... disappointing. The chicken was tough, potentially overcooked or from frozen and chopped way too thick. I'm used to silky smooth meat that's full of flavour. And where was my chicken skin? I know it's not healthy, but surely that should be my decision to make??? This was then covered with a gravy. Surely that's only required if you need to remoisten the meat or add flavour to the bland chicken. Anyway, onto the rice. It had some chicken stock flavour, but was way too sticky and heavy in my opinion. Could have been enhanced with more ginger/garlic. Condiments... The chilli was passable but nothing worth writing about. Apparently you have to specifically ask if you want ginger and sweet soy. I say a lot, but the reputation certainly builds up the expectation. Im willing to try again just to be sure, but for now, my search for the best chicken rice in Singapore continues...
