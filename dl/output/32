5 stars can not even describe this place. I was afraid that it was overhyped since there are plenty of reviews on it and even Anthony Bourdain has eaten here. But its all true, there is no overhype. Tian Tian definitely lives up to all the hype. 
The chicken plate for $4 is amazing. I've never had chicken so juicy and tender and flavorful. Just from looking at it, you can see the plumpness of the chicken meat! You can actually taste the flavor of chicken. I didn't even use the sauces as the chicken itself is the star. I didn't want any sauce to takeaway from the star of the show. I really wish LA could get their hainan chicken act together, even something half as good as tian tian would be nice to have. 
And the rice is just heavenly. Rice itself is perfectly cooked: light and fluffy. The flavors of chicken have immersed itself into each grain of rice. Eaten together with the chicken, its like a party in your mouth. 
I went on a weekday around 2pm, so the line definitely died down. Waited about 10 minutes before I ordered, and another couple minutes to grab the plate of food. After you get your chicken, you can grab a drink at one of the juice stalls in the area (there's one directly across from tian tian). 
I'm salivating just writing this review. I want some Tian Tian hainan chicken rice!!
