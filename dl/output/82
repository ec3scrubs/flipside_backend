Came to this well publicized Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. In general, it's worth the trip and the taste did impress me. Price is decent, about S$4.00 per plate. Here's my two cents,
1) Rice alone taste great, lives up to it's name. Taste great to eat even by itself
2) Chicken alone is bland but texture is good, I guess the favor has gone to either the rice or the chicken oil
3) Chicken with Chicken Oil(Yes, the gravy is solely Chicken oil) taste came in great, the chicken favor are all in the chicken oil
4) Chilli sauce are not hot and has some lime and garlic. Be cautious if you hate garlic
5) Chicken + Chicken Oil + Rice + Chilli sauce = HEAVEN!!!
Lastly, expect long line..... especially during lunch time for about 30 mins
