Google best chicken rice in Singapore and you are sure to find this stall in the list! Located at the heart of maxwell food centre, this stall boast large crowds and occupying two stalls spacing. I ordered a medium serving which when it came, looks plain boring. Aside from the looks, the medium serving gave quite a big portion of chicken! As there was much hype about this stall's chicken rice, I think I expected too much as when I took a bite, nothing was special about it. The chicken and rice was not bad but not "best chicken rice" worthy. The chilli was exceptional which gave life to my bland chicken rice! Expected much more from them!!!!
