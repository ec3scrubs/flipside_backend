So here's the low down. The rice here is fantastic. Just really tasty. The chili-sauce is also really nice as it has a kick of lime in it. The chicken...well...it needed help. Even for a boiled chicken it had little flavor and was kinda slimy and rubbery and fatty at the same time. There are better places to have the whole legendary dish, but if you're near by with some touristing friends, why not.
