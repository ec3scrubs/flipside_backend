The best chicken rice in the whole world! 
It's even worth to come here when you have just an stopover at Singapore airport. It takes about 40 minutes taking the MRT from Changi to get here. Just hop of at stop 15 and go down maxwell road. 
What you see is what you get: chicken and rice ;)
This dish is so tender and flavored! You will love it!
