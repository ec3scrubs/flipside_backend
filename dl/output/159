For one thing, the main photo of this YELP page needs to be changed as it shows the wrong location for this particular stall. 
Anyhow, time for the review.
This is obviously one of the best places in Singapore to get chicken rice, although I wouldn't call it the best because I have had better but also I'm sure that there is a hidden gem that I still haven't found.
The chicken - Juicy, and good portion. The quality of the meat is top notch, except one time they gave me a piece that was all bone, but that was also my fault for not requesting breast meat. 
The chili - One of the best I've had, but I have had better. 
The rice - Good rice, but I've also had better. There is a chicken rice stall in the Redhill Food Centre which I think has better rice and better chili although the quality of the chicken meat isn't as nice. 
I also think that Ah Tai (the competitor to Tian Tian and also run by the ex-chef from Tian Tian) is overall a better stall. 
Try Ah Tai before you make your decision on which is the best.
