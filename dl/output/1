Hainanese Chicken Rice
I came here following many recommendation from tourist books/ guides. But sometime I do wonder whether is true. However now that I have tried this, I can see why this is a must place to try.
This is so delicious I could eat several boxes. The chicken was succulent and what Chinese people would say . (Meat is so juicy). The rice is full of chicken flavour and nor too greasy either. This is a large box for under $8 SD very value for money.
