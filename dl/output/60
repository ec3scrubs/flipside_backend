I was told Tian Tian has the best hainan chicken in Singapore. That's why even though it was closed the first day I went (on a Thursday evening!?) I decided to go again the next day.
Well, first things first, the price was unbeatable. Only $4 for a chicken rice plate?! Although the portion wasn't that big, it was pretty filling and I felt kind of full with just one plate. It was probably the rice - which had a fantastic smell of chicken oil+coconut. The chicken however was just okay. It wasn't very tender and a bit on the dry side. But again the experience of eating the rice itself was so enjoyable that it added points to the chicken as well.
I give 4 stars mostly because of the price and the rice. Quality of the chicken and the long line doesn't really justify it to be a 5-star restaurant. If I could go to Singapore again, this wouldn't be on my list of "must-go" restaurants but I wouldn't mind dropping by and grabbing a plate.
