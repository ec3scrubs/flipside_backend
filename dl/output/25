After many people were raving about this place (and being a self-confessed Antony Bourdain fan) I HAD to visit. I was a little disappointed. I returned twice and each time the consistency is not there. I found the rice to be dry and another time to be oily. The soup lacked flavour and the chicken had a great texture, but not too flavoursome. I have had much better sadly. 
Too much hype in my opinion and a line that is far too long.
