I haven't tried many C&amp;R places, but this is definitely the best I've had so far. The differences are subtle, but mainly I think its the flavor of the rice and overall freshness (likely driven at least partially by the demand) that sets this place apart.
Lines can be long, but they move fast. The problem is they often run out of food.
