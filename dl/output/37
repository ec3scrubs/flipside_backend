I mean, it's a legend for a reason. This was my first chicken and rice experience (but not my last), and I'll remember it fondly.
The chicken itself was moist and tender. Not the highest of quality (I feel Heng Ji at Chinatown is higher quality), but not poor by any means. The rice certainly shines, and was delicious. 
Was here on a Saturday evening and the line wasn't too long. The food centre wasn't too busy either and I got a table no problem.
