I never saw the TV episode featuring this hawker stall, but based on various recommendations I came here for lunch on Saturday. Looking for one of the stalls with the long lines There are two lines, one to order and pay, and the other one to pick up. 
Despite having chicken rice at Boon Tong Kee the night before, we ordered one plate of chicken rice to share. Chicken was good and tender, but I preferred the version at Boon Tong Kee. I definitely thought the rice was more aromatic here!
Plenty of open seating in the small aisle behind the stall.
