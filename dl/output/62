Had the $5 chicken rice, asked for Coriander leaves and guess what?! The owner said $5 one doesn't come with it!! Really?! All chicken rice must have it no matter what. Too bad!! Oh and no soup too!!
Anyway, the chicken meat wasn't as tender or smooth as my expectation. Although their chilli sauce is good.
