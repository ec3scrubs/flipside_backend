This may be a case of YMMV but I found this place to be overrated.. mayb it's because of the constant demand, countless bowls of chicken rice are served continuously! There was a line that wraps around the corner when I first came and there still was a line after I finished eating. 
The chicken rice... hmmmm it wasn't fragrant at all! It was cold and hard. Not what I'd expect. Thumbs down on the rice for me... 
The chicken.... hmmm I found it to be course and dry in the breast area and the leg was nice and silky. I didn't mind it actually. But to claim as the best ... I doubt it... I've had so much better in Shenzhen and also in Melbourne. this is my experience only .. Give it a go still.. it may be different for you.. at least it is one to cross off the list.
