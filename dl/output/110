It's hard to find a good plate of Hainan chicken rice in the states. The best are Savoy and Green Zone in San Gabriel. Here at Tian Tian, the food is hawker-style - no fancy platings or decorations on the dishes. Just plain good chicken and rice. The rice was very flavorful - good enough to be eaten alone - and the chicken was very tender. I usually don't like to eat the skin but with Tian Tian's, it didn't even matter. Price for a plate is about US$7 per person.
