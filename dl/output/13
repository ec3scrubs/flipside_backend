Wasn't that impressed, especially after the hype.
In a matter of just a few days, I had sampled 4 different Hainenese Chicken Rice places - some reputable like this and others just random - and was not impressed at all. Some of the random places had much more flavorful rice, but wonder is this place is just riding off the reputation now.
A friend from Singapore agreed that it's nothing special. I was pretty disappointed, but oh well.
