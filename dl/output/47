It was as if clouds took rice form and were cooked in an amazing broth of just right seasoning - that is what the rice is like from TianTian. Having first tried the chicken rice in Chinatown, I had an "okay" benchmark of what it could be compared to. This little hawker stall (or rather two hawker stalls) lived up to the hype. 
The rice was flavorful, fragrant and indeed was eaten by itself for a few moments before realizing there was a half chicken waiting to be consumed also. Paired with the soy and chili sauce, the chicken and the rice worked together wonderfully, and left me to wonder if this was better than 53rd and 6th's own Chicken and Rice. My conclusion: it holds its weight. 
A must-try if visiting Singapore. Not just because a celebrity chef said so, but because food should be considered a way to get to know a new culture intimately. And with this simple dish, you definitely feel at home, even thousands of miles away.
