I've reviewed a few chicken rice so far, but let me reiterate the 3 main factors that I rate chicken rice on (in order of priority): the rice, the chicken and finally the chilli.
There has been a big hoo-haa about Tian Tian, and since I don't stay near the area or work near the area, this is actually my 2nd visit. 
I visited Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice at 3.30 pm on a weekday and was surprised that there was a queue. Looks like this stall is certainty famous.
First of all, let's talk about the rice. The rice was fragrant and flavourful. However, not all the grains of the rice were soft. Some stuck together and were hard.
The chicken drizzled in a 'special' sauce mixed by Tian Tian was amazingly tender, fleshy and tasty. I also tried the chilli sauce, and it was delicious! Together with the chicken, it definitely brings the taste up to a whole new level.
Overall, Tian Tian definitely serves up one of the best chicken rice in Singapore, but if you're not a fan of queuing, better think twice about coming here especially during the peak mealtimes.
