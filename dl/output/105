Hawker stalls are sort of the THING in Singapore, and this is THE place to be since Anthony Bourdain, Gordon Ramsay etc have been here.
Chicken rice was amazing. Full of flavor, rich and creamy from the chicken broth. BUT! the chicken itself wasn't spectacular - sort of slimy, and not a ton of meat, mostly bones. Boo. 
My best rec? 
Get the chicken rice from TIan Tian, then meander a few stalls down to add some soy sauce chicken to your rice. Awwesome mix.
