My cousin who lived in Singapore for a while highly recommended Tian Tian's chicken rice. So took our hungry selves for a late lunch. Was shocked to see a long line to the counter and from what I heard from my cousin, that was quite typical of Singapore, especially the good ones.
We waited in line and really hoped that the chicken rice would be worth the long wait. I saw a number of people walking with their chicken rice plates and quite honestly they didn't look appetizing at all.
Finally got the counter and ordered their much famed chicken rice. They drop a bowl of rice on the plate, some sauce in it and chicken breast slices on the top, and a few slices on cucumber on the side.
Would never imagine that something that looks so simple cab taste so good. Wow wow wow, I can't stop raving about this dish. It is so flavorful. Worth it, the long wait was totally worth it!!!
