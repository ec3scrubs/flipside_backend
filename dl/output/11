Truth be told...I never tried the Hainanese Chicken Rice before and wasn't sure what the hype was about other than the famous Anthony Bourdain visiting this stall. Came here with a couple of friends and we went super early before opening time to avoid the long lines.
Place opened roughly around 10am, but do be prepared to wait in a line since this place is pretty popular among the locals and tourists. Wait time for the food wasn't too long and the portion amount was decent.
Overall, the chicken rice wasn't mind blowing, but rather, it was a tasty dish. The rice was quite flavorful and fragrant and the chicken was soft and tender. I definitely like the house made chili that definitely had a lot of zing and spicy to it.
Still haven't figured out why there is such a craze for this dish but it's worth the try if you like chicken rice. Also, I noticed that a lot of other competing chicken rice stalls have a similar look to Tian Tian, so do check the names before waiting in line if you're looking for the "famous" chicken rice place (aka Tian Tian). 
Another recommendation I have is if you're in a group, have one person make the order for everyone. Saves time and it does make the line shorter ;)
