If you choose to come here for their Hainan chicken, be prepared to queue up for a little while! When we visited Maxwell Center, there were numerous Hainan chicken joints inside. But none of them had nearly as long of a line as Tian Tian did! 
Though it's a typical small sized stall that you'd expect at any hawker centre in Singapore, they've got enough manpower that the division of labor with such little space is impressive! Order after order is rolled out so efficiently that your mouth just waters as the queue gets shorter. 
If it's 2-3 of you, I highly suggest grabbing half a chicken and 3 rice bowls! Soup is included, along with all the condiments (it's not Hainan chicken without all the sauces)! The chicken is so damn succulent that you'll want to eat it until the very last bit of meat (and veins) that you're nearly close to the bone marrow!
If you know some Chinese (or getting a bit rusty), this is your chance to speak it as some of the ladies passing you the food don't know too much English (maybe some Singlish though, haha). 
And don't forget to snap a picture of the food porn before you start digging in!
