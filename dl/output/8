After hearing all the hype abut this place - award winning chef, when they sell out, they just close shop, the line is always a mile long, etc. just sets up this joint for a harder fall.
Situated in the famous Maxwell Hawker market, it wasn't too hard to find. Yes, just look for the stall with the longest line. With about 27 people in front of me, I decided to just take a number and fall into line.
When it was time to order, the register lady was Soup Nazi like and there were signs instructing how to order and to get your cash ready. Puleeze... I got the half chicken and chicken rice.  
First mistake - I had to ask for soy sauce.
Second mistake - They did not provide a fresh ground ginger oil condiment.
Third - The chicken and rice tasted just okay. Not mind blowing,
