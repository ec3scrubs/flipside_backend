This is definitely the best Hainan Chicken I've ever had. I ordered 2 drum stick chicken with rice (I like the dark meat) and a plate of veggies. The chilli sauce really gives it an extra pizzazz. Queue was long but it moved quickly. I liked it so much I came back for another meal the day I was leaving.
