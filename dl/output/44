Really cheap eat! We had ordered a chicken rice to share! And the only thing we did wrong was not ordered an extra rice to go with it! As I'm not a big meat eater, all I wanted was the rice! The rice was so flavourful! Definitely worth the hype to come here! We were lucky and showed up just before the crowd!
Can't wait to come back!
