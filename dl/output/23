My favorite place for chicken rice! We totally lucked out because we never waited the two times we ate here. Must be because we eat during off-peak times but better for us because it made me love this place even more! They give a generous portion of chicken which is way it wins in the chicken rice war. Love the ginger sauce as well. I add the thick soy sauce to the rice and mix it together. Yum! One of my favorite meals in Singapore.
