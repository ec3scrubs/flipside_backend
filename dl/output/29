Yes you will wait about 20min or so to order, but don't let that deter you. This chicken rice really is that good. I tried the closest competitor a few booths down, which apparently was an ex-exmployee of Tian Tian, side by side and there really is a difference. Tian Tian dish is more subtle in taste compared to the other which tastes mostly like garlic. Anytime I am in Singapore this is my first stop and should be yours too, Chicken Rice is simply the most simplest complex looking dish anywhere and is not to be missed.
