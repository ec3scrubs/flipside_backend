Do expect a long line as the Singaporeans all some to gather to what is supposedly the best. This is a perfect example of things not living up to the hype. The wait can be fairly long even though they work fairly fast, and be prepared that they may run out of food before you make it to the counter. The service can at best be described as efficient but a more accurate description may be half-rude. I guess they can afford to as they are so popular.
The food is chicken rice and I will admit that I do fail to see the greatness of this dish, although I have had a few decent ones. This one barely qualifies as decent as it does lack some of the freshness and also appear to use some chicken that is not the highest quality. The rice was however very fresh and tasted really nicely. There will however not be any repeat visits for me.
