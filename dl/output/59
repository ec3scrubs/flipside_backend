I think Bourdain really sums it all. "Chicken Rice so fragrant and delicious it can be eaten on its own". The rice is good, everything else is forgettable. What's wrong with the chicken? It is so bland - even with their special sauce. I can't help but think there must be something wrong with my palette. Maybe that's how Singaporeans and the rest of the world likes it. To me, I will take Thai chicken rice and/or Hong Kong style Hainanese chicken rice on any given day.
