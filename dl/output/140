DUDE! WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE?! I kept hearing amazing things about Tian Tian from Anthony Bourdain to family members here, but I went yesterday evening and I didn't stars, I wasn't blown out of my seat, instead it was just a total let down! I've seen angels come from bright lights because of amazing chicken rice I had in Singapore (ok a little dramatic), but not by this place.
I don't care that the service sucked, I don't care that it was in a hot hawker center, I don't care that there are tons of tourists, I don't care about long lines, what I always care about is the TASTE, and I've honestly had better. What I liked though, was the price. So I guess if you happen to be in the Chinatown neighborhood, and you want cheap Chicken rice ($3.50 to be exact), it's a pretty decent option. But by no means would I say it's the best in Singapore.
