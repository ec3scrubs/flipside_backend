Some of my local friends recommended me to try on a weekend instead of the weekdays to avoid the crowd. So was here on a weekend but the queue was snaking long. Oh well... it was WORTH the wait! Authentic &amp; local. 
The rice and steamed chicken was flavourful. Gotta try the chili sauce with it. Only found the chicken soup to be a tad too oily.
Try it!
