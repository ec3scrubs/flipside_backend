Super flavorful chicken rice as recommended by many locals and other visitors. Very simple yet tasty. The garlic chili dipping sauce was a great accompaniment and I asked for the thick black soy sauce which apparently is for those in the know...luckily I have friends in the know. Long line was intimidating but it went super fast so it didn't feel long at all. Definitely recommended!
