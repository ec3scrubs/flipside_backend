i must preface by saying that i never order chicken out. i'm not a big fan of chicken, b/c i usually think it's bland, but i do make an exception in the case of hainan chicken rice. i think this place had the best hainan chicken rice of all the places i tried in singapore. the rice was really flavorful here, and the chicken was poached just right. they gave more white meat too, which i like better.
