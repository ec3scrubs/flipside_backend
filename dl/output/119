I'm visiting and went here based on a recommendation (that I will not follow again). This place had the longest que signifying that this was the favorite. After receiving the chicken and rice, I had a hard time swallowing a poached slime like chicken with skin that was like flesh. I think that the desire was for quantity and not quality here. Very little flavor, poor texture and a waste of time and calories is my take.
