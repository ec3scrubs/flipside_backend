The best chicken rice in town. I know because I've lived here for many years, and chicken rice happens to be my favorite local dish. I've exhausted the many options available, but at the end of the day, it still boils down to this stall. After all, Anthony Bourdain can't be wrong, can he? I think to achieve the perfect chicken rice dish, both the chicken and rice must be excellent, and I've had many plates from many places that serves either perfect chicken or perfect rice. This stall serves the most fragrant rice which is moist and flavorful, and coupled with the chilli sauce, is exceptional. The chicken is very tasty, and very tender. Definitely a number 1 stop for tourists and locals (if you haven't tried it).
