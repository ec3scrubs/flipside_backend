YUM!! (well until I learned how many calories are in chicken rice....)
This place was awesome. The queue was long, but worth the wait!
The rice was so flavorful and the soup perfect!
I was a little intimidated on how quickly the people were working and taking orders. Thankfully I had my fiance who spoke the language to order and pay.
I wish Singapore wasn't 25 hours away....otherwise I'd be here more!
