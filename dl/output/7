This place has the best Hainanese chicken rice I've ever had. I order this dish anywhere it's available, so I've had my fair share of Hainanese chicken rice. But this place has the best. This unassuming food stand that seems to always have a line wrapping around the corner at Maxwell is it. The rice is so flavorful that I can eat two bowls and still want more. I'm not a fan of white meat due to typical dryness, but when they ran out of chicken drumstick/leg, I had to settle for breast. And to my surprise, the white breast meat was tender and juicy. The chicken skin is super smooth and silky. I usually don't eat chicken skin, but I just couldn't help myself. During my short two days visit, this is the only thing I ate more than once. So, this place is legit.
