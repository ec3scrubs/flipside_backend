Upon our travels to Singapore, Chicken rice was on my food fanatic husbands agenda. Yes, we stood in the Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice line. It is what I had expected as far as flavor. Good chicken with flavorful rice. My only suggestion is to order the whole chicken. Half a chicken is not enough! It seemed like it was 1/4 of a chicken. Especially if you are a tourist, order the whole chicken! Don't wait in line for a few pieces of chicken. Get the whole thing!
