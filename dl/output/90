Very good chicken rice here. Try the half chicken and rice. Be sure not to let the cool chicken broth with the half chicken go to waste. I think it tastes best poured onto the rice. Love the garlic chili sauce.
I'm learning that there really isn't a "best chicken rice" in Singapore. There's either Chicken Rice made properly or chicken rice not made properly.
It is made very properly here. Comfort food at its finest.
