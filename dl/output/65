I was told that I absolutely had to try this place in Singapore, so my friend and I stopped by the hawker center to give it a try. Yes, the line is long, but don't worry, it moves pretty quickly. Before you get in line to order, it's good to walk around the hawker center and browse at what other folks are eating. Look at the plates to identify which stall the food comes from. This will give you a better understanding about the food options they have - whole chicken, half chicken, single serving with rice, veggies, etc. 
Since my friend and I were trying lots of different stalls for lunch, we ordered a single serving for each of us. The chicken is super soft and smooth, definitely not something you can find in the states. Who can complain about $3.50 for chicken, rice, and soup?
