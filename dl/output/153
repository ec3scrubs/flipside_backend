This is my favourite chicken rice ever! I know the chicken rice wars have a bit of a religious tone to it, and you might hate Tian Tian for various reasons, but... I don't care. I like it.
Seriously, the queue is really long. It's very popular with tourists and locals alike. Expect to queue -- a lot.
I like it for the fluffy rice and lovely chicken. I think I like it best because it has the better 'pak cham gai' among all the other so-called famous ones. *shrug*
