We walked through miserable Singapore heat and humidity to find the "Anthony Bourdain hainan chicken place." I have to say I don't really understand why it's so amazing. The chicken was mushy and soft, which I felt like is a lack of texture. Pricing is reasonable for a half a chicken, but I feel like you can get the same Hainan chicken anywhere in Singapore and there isn't really need to make a special trip for this food market to check out this place.
