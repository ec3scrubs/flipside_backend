The line for this place are ridiculous, but luckily they have a corner stall where the line can naturally curve around and form outside the Hawker Center. I don't know much about chicken rice, but with my Singaporean husband, I naturally get dragged to all the so called famous food stalls and restaurants. Tian Tian was no different, highly reviewed by Anthony Bourdain, which draws in the tourist crowd like myself, but locals eat there too. I think we must have waited for half an hour for the food, but that's probably our fault for strolling in there right at lunch time on a weekend.
After staking out my table, while the husband finally makes it through the long line, I get to try the famous chicken rice. It was delicious! It was gently cooked, which some might think is slimy, but I've never had chicken so tender. The chickens are young so therefore on the small side, but how else will you get chicken meat to be so soft if it weren't young and probably less processed then the chickens we have in the U.S. The sauces are the highlight, must douse everything in lots of sauce!
Lesson learned, try to come before 12 especially on a weekend, but I don't think crowds can be avoided here, only minimized.
