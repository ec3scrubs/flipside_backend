They occupy two stalls. First stall (the corner one) is to take order and make payment. Then you proceed to the 2nd stall to pass them your receipt. 
Verdict? There are better ones out there. This is too overrated. Chicken is dry but generous amount. Rice is so so. But chilli tasted pretty fresh. Tangy and spicy. ;) 
On the whole, didn't expect this much hyped chicken rice to taste so (less than) mediocre.
