After all the hype I most definitely had to give it a go. After passing by Maxwell on a Sunday and realizing the queue was only about 8 people (usually there's up to a 45 minute wait) I decided I would give it a try. The chicken rice is alright, a bit greasy for my taste, and they tend to add some gravy-like dressing on it when served which I have to say definitely gives it a nice flavor boost. I have to say, though, that anything upwards of $5 is a bit steep for chicken rice which, yes, may have beat Gordon Ramsey, but what does he know about chicken rice? While I'm glad I gave it a try, I'll stick to my usual fares for a shorter wait and a lesser of a dent in the wallet.
