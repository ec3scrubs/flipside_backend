First, the hainanese chicken is wonderful. However the time waiting in line isn't worth the differential to other hainanese chicken you can get elsewhere. Put another way, it's good but you can get something pretty comparable elsewhere with no wait at the same price or cheaper. 
Very good food but seems a bit overhyped in my opinion.
