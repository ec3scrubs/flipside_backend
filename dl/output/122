Please remember that this place is located in the Maxwell Food Center near Chinatown. I tried telling 10 taxi drivers Tian Tian Chicken Rice and only the last 1 of the 10 knew what I was talking about.
This vendor is the only vendor in the food center (maybe even all of Singapore) that occupies two stalls. The lines are long during the lunch rush hour so you definitely want to go before or after the rush. For 3 SGD, you get a generous portion of rice and chicken meat (white meat) with some secret brown chicken sauce poured on top of the chicken and rice. Tasty indeed. You'll want to compliment it with a freshly sugar cane drink from the stall directly across from it.
Note that this is the only vendor that has a Facebook and Twitter page. I wonder if they have a healthcare plan too.
