Such a simple concept, but it is so darn delicious! I had to try chicken rice after my boyfriend continuously talked about it! We made our way to the Hawker Center that Anthony Bourdain visited as well (evident by the huge photo of him by Tian Tian's stand)
It was around 5 pieces of tender chicken with chicken fat poured over it, served with white rice and hot sauce! They give you a choice between the small &amp; large place, but by the looks of my large plate, the small one must be meant for a mouse!
Overall, great local food (even if it doesn't really constitute Singaporean food) and great taste! I wish I could have another and another and another plate..!
