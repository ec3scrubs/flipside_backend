Located inside Maxwell's Food court is a gem. There are so many hawker stands it is hard to figure out which one to visit. A must visit if you want authentic Hainan Chicken rice. The staff is super nice! They are very honest and helpful. We asked for a whole chicken thinking it would be small portions but the lady asked how many people will be eating. When we said two she said half chicken is more than enough. The rice is super flavorful! We ordered to go and the one complaint I had is they did not pack any ginger sauce. When I think of Hainan Chicken rice I think ginger sauce and yummy rice. For me the star of the dish is the rice. Need to add the ginger sauce. The chicken was juicy and tender. We ordered bean sprouts ans that was delicious!! It tasted very much like home cooked meal. Amazing!!! Cannot wait to go back. This time I will make sure I get the ginger sauce.
