Waited 45 minutes in the sweltering Singapore heat. Not sure if my expectations were too high or the long wait just put a damper on things - but the chicken rice just wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped. In fact, I would have been more satisfied if I'd just gone to my usual chicken rice place in Marina Square (a 'must do' each time I visit Singapore). The chicken was moist but I don't think the flavour was as good as some other places. And was not a fan of their chilli sauce. The rice was probably the winner. This place was on my bucket list - so am glad I get to tick the box. Not likely to return though. Not for the chicken rice anyway. Wouldn't mind trying some of the other stalls at the Maxwell Food Centre.
