I'm going to say this is the best chicken rice I've ever had. EVER. 
On a recent trip to Singapore I visited twice in a 36 hour period and now compare every other chicken rice meal to Tian Tian.
The lines may be daunting, but they move quickly and the staff here move swiftly to fulfil orders and have you on your way with mounds of steaming rice, silky chicken, perfectly balances chili sauce and broth in moments. Put a member of your group in line while the others hunt down drinks and a table.
